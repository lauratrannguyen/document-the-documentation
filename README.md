### Document the Documentation

This project was created as part of a GenUI Hackathon held at HealthEdge in May 2025. We used generative AI tools, primarily Cursor, to build
a Storybook that provides examples of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2 in action.

The accessibility stories describe common pitfalls and challenges that a developer might face when building accessible frontends and provide suggestions
for working past these difficulties, while still conforming to WCAG 2.2.

The Storybook sections are sorted according to the WCAG documentation, which can be found (here)[https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/].

Start Storybook by running `npm run storybook`.
